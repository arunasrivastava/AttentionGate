        "- **Step 1:** The `tokenizer()` function takes the input prompt and converts it into a format that the model can understand. This is essentially converting the input prompt into a sequence of tokens. Note that the tokenizer returns a dictionary with the tokenized input ids and attention mask. The `input_ids` are the token ids that the model will use as input. `\"attention_mask`\" is a mask vector that indicates if a particular token corresponds to padding. Padding is extremely important when we are dealing with variable length sequences. Through padding, we can ensure that all the sequences in a batch are of the same size. When feeding sequences with padding to a transformer based model, we need to make sure that the model doesn't attend to the padding tokens. The `attention_mask` is used the tokens that are to be ignored in the attention operation. Note that here since we only used a single input sequence, there was no need of padding and that's why all the attention mask values are 1, i.e. none of the tokens in the sequences should be ignored by attention blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Step 2:** The `generate()` function takes the tokenized input and generates a sequence of tokens as output. The function takes in a number of arguments, the most important of which are `max_new_tokens` and `do_sample`. The `max_new_tokens` argument specifies the maximum number of new tokens to be generated. The `do_sample` argument is used to turn on sampling, if false, greedy decoding is used. If `do_sample` is set to `True`, then the `top_p` and `temperature` arguments are used to control the sampling process. The `top_p` argument is the value of $p$ parameter for top-p or nucleus sampling and the `temperature` argument is used to control the temperature sampling. Notice that the `generate()` function returns as output a sequence of token ids.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Step 3:** The `tokenizer.decode` method converts the token ids into text. The `skip_special_tokens=True` argument is used to ignore the special tokens (e.g. start of sequence, end of sequence, padding etc.) that are added by the tokenizer.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Step 3 (Optional):** The `generate()` function returns the model inputs as well. We can ignore that by slicing the output."

        "In this part of the homework, we will learn how we can use knowledge distillation from a larger teacher model to a smaller student model. Particularly, we will be focusing on the task of text summarization and using the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. We will use Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct as our teacher model, which is a 1.5B parameter decoder-only mode pre-trained on 18T tokens of data and then further fine-tuned to follow instructions to perform different tasks (similar to something like ChatGPT). You can read more about Qwen2.5 models [here](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5/). For the student model, we will be using the default GPT-2 model, which is a 124M parameter model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct is a much bigger model and trained on a lot of data, it is more capable of generating better summaries as compared to the default GPT-2 model which is a smaller model and has seen less data. Knowledge distillation is a technique to transfer the knowledge of a larger teacher model to a smaller student model. In this way, we can leverage the large amount of data and compute resources used to train the teacher model to improve the performance of the student model.\n",

Instruction tuned models are obtained from base language models by fine-tuning them on a diverse set of instructions and their desired outputs.

        "- In the tokenization dictionary, we now need to add a new key, `labels,` which contains the labels to train the language model. For language models, the labels are the same as the input IDs since the model is expected to generate the next word in the sequence. However, while fine-tuning, we want the model to learn how to generate the summaries from the articles and we do not care about the model learning to predict tokens in the original articles. Therefore, we replace the labels for the prompt tokens with -100, which is a special token id that is used to signal the loss function to ignore the loss for those tokens.\n"
